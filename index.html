		<div><h2>About the Vita Project</h2></div>
			<div><p>The Vita Project is intended for the people of Madison to set down their technology, listen to one another and learn from sharing expereinces. The project has no concrete material to be covered and is instead aimed for an open discussion about life experiences.
			An informal voluntary interview will be held to learn about your life experiences, greatest memories and perspective on the world we live in. The interview can be anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours dependent upon your avaliability and how much you would like to share!</p></div>
			<div><p>The goal of The Vita Project is to listen to everyone's story and learn a different perspective on life. I hope to learn a wide variety of information from how others perceive the world to what gets people out of bed each day. I have yet to decide what I will do with all of my learnings, but I am considering a few ideas such as: writing a report, creating a short video or giving a presentation.</p></div>
		
		<div><h2>The "Interview"</h2></div>
			<div><p>The questions asked can range anywhere from learning about your career experiences to childhood and family life. If you are uncomfortable sharing parts of your life no problem! The conversation can be steered in any direction the interviewee would like to go. Overall, the "interview" is a friendly conversation that is intended to learn all about the interviewee's life.</p></div>
			<div><p>The interview can be held anywhere around Madison where the interviewee feels most comfortable. Whether it be at a park, a coffee shop or in the interviewee's home the location can be decided on a case by case scenario.</p></div>
		
		<div><h2>The Ideal Interviewee</h2></div>
			<div><p>Everyone! No matter your background I am very interested in learning perspectives from all walks of life. If you have a story to tell I would love to hear it. The one caveat being that this is a Madison-based project. Therefore, the interview will need to be within the greater Madison area.</p></div>
		
		<div><h2>Information About Me</h2></div>
			<div><p>My name is Tanner and I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm in the business school studying Operations and Technology Management with a specialization in Health Care Management. In my free time I love being outdoors and spending time with family and friends. As you may have guessed I also love listening to people's life stories! The Vita Project was inspired from my frequent urge to ask questions and inherent interest in learning about the experiences that shape people to who they have become. With that being said, I am excited to meet you and hear your story!</p></div>
		
		<div><h2>Setting Up an Interview</h2></div>
			<div><p>Interviews will be set up on a case by case scenario. Being that I am a student and hold an internship, evenings and weekends work best for me. Eitherway I am sure we can set up a time and location that works for both of us.</p></div>
			<div><p>To set up a voluntary interview please email me via the contact details left below. I will do my best to email you back promptly. From there I can also give you my phone number if you would like to discuss the project over a call.</p></div>
